# OOP_Project2
Kyle McDevitt
Developed in Python 3.7

This project was done in Python 3.7 making use of the Strategy and Observer Design Patterns.  I used the Strategy Pattern for delegating the animal noise behavior and the animal roam behavior where the animal noise was handled at the lowest sub-class(ex. Cat) and roam was handled at the intermediate sub-class(ex. Canine).  To run the code, make sure Python 3 is installed and download all of the files as is into one directory and run the main module.
